# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: Thursday, October 8, 2020 - Setting up GitHub and starting to code.

**Today's Progress**: Completed the Basic HTML and HTML5 lesson from freeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts:** Today was a good day of building confidence. I new most of the topics that were being taught, but I was able to complete the challenges pretty easily. I appreciated that I could do the coding. Looking forward to tomorrow and the next 99 days. 



### Day 2: Friday, October 9th, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Completed CSS Basics course from freeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts** Enjoyed the refresher of CSS properties. I was pleased that I learned more about CSS class and id selectors, as well as custom CSS variables and how they are inherited. Look forward to using these new skills in future projects. 

### Day 3: Monday, October 12th, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Started the Applied Visual Design lessons on freeCodeCamp

**Thoughts** Really enjoyed today's coding. It was some fundamental understanding that I needed and didn't get in the few classes I have taken. Reminded myself that this coding challenge isn't about completion, it is about coding everyday. I missed a few days unfortunately in the chaos of life, but I am back now and ready to head full steam!

### Day 4: Tuesday, October 13th, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Finished the Applied Visual Design lessons on freeCodeCamp

**Thoughts** Felt great! Learned some interesting ways to use animations of elements. Used skews, ::before, ::after, and @keyframes.

### Day 5: Wednesday, October 14th, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Started the Accessibility Design lessons on freeCodeCamp

**Thoughts** Loved coding today's lessons. As a former educator who worked with student's with disabilities, it is important to me that any project I work on is accessible for anyone trying to access it. I look forward to using this skills to improve the projects I have already created and implementing them in to the design and development of any future project. 

### Day 6: Thursday, October 16th, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Finished the Accessibility Design lessons and Responsive Web Design lessons on freeCodeCamp

**Thoughts** Coding in HTML and CSS is fairly easy for me. I am created a notebook of the properties so that when I want to use them, I will have an easily accessible resource, right at my finger tips. 

### Day 7: Monday, October 19th, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Completed the CSS Flexbox lessons on freeCodeCamp

**Thoughts** I love that I have found a resource that allows me to apply the skills I already have, and then learn new ones related to them. I may have to do #100DaysofCode slightly different than originally planned. With my family life, it is better for me to code Monday through Friday. I still the skills that I need and am able to balance home life responsibilities. 

### Day 8: Wednesday, October 21st, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Completed the CSS Grid lessons on freeCodeCamp

**Thoughts** New learning for CSS. CSS Grid frameworks are so amazing. I love that each day I am learning more fundamentals that will aide me in my further development in front end design and developing. 

### Day 9: Wednesday, October 21st, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Updating and refining my Front End Development Portfolio

**Thoughts** Spent a significant amount of time refining my portfolio. Updated background, pictures, added new images and links. It is beautiful on my local machine, but it isn't communicating with BlueHost my service supporter. That is a solution for tomorrow's work.
