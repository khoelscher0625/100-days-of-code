# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: Thursday, October 8, 2020 - Setting up GitHub and starting to code.

**Today's Progress**: Completed the Basic HTML and HTML5 lesson from freeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts:** Today was a good day of building confidence. I new most of the topics that were being taught, but I was able to complete the challenges pretty easily. I appreciated that I could do the coding. Looking forward to tomorrow and the next 99 days.
