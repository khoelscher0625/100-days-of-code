# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: Thursday, October 8, 2020 - Setting up GitHub and starting to code.

**Today's Progress**: Completed the Basic HTML and HTML5 lesson from freeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts:** Today was a good day of building confidence. I new most of the topics that were being taught, but I was able to complete the challenges pretty easily. I appreciated that I could do the coding. Looking forward to tomorrow and the next 99 days. 



### Day 2: Friday, October 9th, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Completed CSS Basics course from freeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts** Enjoyed the refresher of CSS properties. I was pleased that I learned more about CSS class and id selectors, as well as custom CSS variables and how they are inherited. Look forward to using these new skills in future projects. 

### Day 3: Monday, October 12th, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Started the Applied Visual Design lessons on freeCodeCamp

**Thoughts** Really enjoyed today's coding. It was some fundamental understanding that I needed and didn't get in the few classes I have taken. Reminded myself that this coding challenge isn't about completion, it is about coding everyday. I missed a few days unfortunately in the chaos of life, but I am back now and ready to head full steam!

### Day 4: Tuesday, October 13th, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Finished the Applied Visual Design lessons on freeCodeCamp

**Thoughts** Felt great! Learned some interesting ways to use animations of elements. Used skews, ::before, ::after, and @keyframes.
