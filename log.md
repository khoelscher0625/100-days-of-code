# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: Thursday, October 8, 2020 - Setting up GitHub and starting to code.

**Today's Progress**: Completed the Basic HTML and HTML5 lesson from freeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts:** Today was a good day of building confidence. I new most of the topics that were being taught, but I was able to complete the challenges pretty easily. I appreciated that I could do the coding. Looking forward to tomorrow and the next 99 days. 



### Day 2: Friday, October 9th, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Completed CSS Basics course from freeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts** Enjoyed the refresher of CSS properties. I was pleased that I learned more about CSS class and id selectors, as well as custom CSS variables and how they are inherited. Look forward to using these new skills in future projects. 

### Day 3: Monday, October 12th, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Started the Applied Visual Design lessons on freeCodeCamp

**Thoughts** Really enjoyed today's coding. It was some fundamental understanding that I needed and didn't get in the few classes I have taken. Reminded myself that this coding challenge isn't about completion, it is about coding everyday. I missed a few days unfortunately in the chaos of life, but I am back now and ready to head full steam!

### Day 4: Tuesday, October 13th, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Finished the Applied Visual Design lessons on freeCodeCamp

**Thoughts** Felt great! Learned some interesting ways to use animations of elements. Used skews, ::before, ::after, and @keyframes.

### Day 5: Wednesday, October 14th, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Started the Accessibility Design lessons on freeCodeCamp

**Thoughts** Loved coding today's lessons. As a former educator who worked with student's with disabilities, it is important to me that any project I work on is accessible for anyone trying to access it. I look forward to using this skills to improve the projects I have already created and implementing them in to the design and development of any future project. 

### Day 6: Thursday, October 16th, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Finished the Accessibility Design lessons and Responsive Web Design lessons on freeCodeCamp

**Thoughts** Coding in HTML and CSS is fairly easy for me. I am created a notebook of the properties so that when I want to use them, I will have an easily accessible resource, right at my finger tips. 

### Day 7: Monday, October 19th, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Completed the CSS Flexbox lessons on freeCodeCamp

**Thoughts** I love that I have found a resource that allows me to apply the skills I already have, and then learn new ones related to them. I may have to do #100DaysofCode slightly different than originally planned. With my family life, it is better for me to code Monday through Friday. I still the skills that I need and am able to balance home life responsibilities. 

### Day 8: Wednesday, October 21st, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Completed the CSS Grid lessons on freeCodeCamp

**Thoughts** New learning for CSS. CSS Grid frameworks are so amazing. I love that each day I am learning more fundamentals that will aide me in my further development in front end design and developing.
